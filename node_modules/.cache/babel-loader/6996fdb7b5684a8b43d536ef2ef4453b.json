respond to balance biking and how quickly they develop their confidence and coordination. Within minutes children who have never been on a bike before are walking confidently, sat on the saddle. Soon they are weaving in and out of cones, ducking under limbos and flying over ramps. Before long and within the session the same children are beginning to balance and freewheel as they continue to grow in confidence.</p>\n            <p>Each Taster Day offers multiple sessions (4-6 in a school day) catering for up to 60 children in 30-45 minute sessions. Under the watchful eye of a qualified instructor, each child as young as three learns the basics of stepping, striding, balancing, starting and stopping, and turning through a series of fun activities in an action-packed session.</p>\n            <p>Sessions can take place indoors or out depending on weather and are suitable for all levels of ability from absolute beginners to confident pedlers. All equipment is provided including Strider balance bikes and helmets.</p>\n            <p>Taster days are designed as a stand-alone activity day and as such are suitable for use as a one-off experience but can be used to trial balance biking as a regular activity, perhaps prior to starting a school club or investing in equipment and training or running a Freewheelerz Learn to Ride Course.</p>\n        </div>\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"KS1 Taster Days\",\n        img: \"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0583da_2a23f2f85f5a47a299fc9f9a689e3e26~mv2.png/v1/crop/x_76,y_1,w_294,h_282/fill/w_412,h_389,al_c,lg_1,q_85/Untitled12.webp\",\n        header: \"Fun interactive sessions for KS1 to stimulate interest, develop confidence and gain new skills through games and challenges.\",\n        featured: false,\n        //wrong flyer\n        flyer: TasterDays,\n        description: <div>\n            <p>Get your kids pedaling with a ProRide Cycling Taster Day</p> \n            <p>Cycling is a great activity for children in so many ways, yet for many, finding somewhere safe and fun to ride their bikes and learn new skills is difficult.

The focus then switches to developing bike handling skills by using a series of activity stations where the children tackle different obstacles such as slalom, limbo, and ramps. Finally, the children get their chance to take on their friends in a series of fun races tailored to the age and ability of the group and the space available.</p> \n            <p>Children bring in their own bikes and helmets, but spares can be provided by prior arrangement.

Well, now they can with Freewheelerz, our latest program for EYFS.</p>\n                <p>The drive behind this new program came about as a result of the positive feedback we have been getting from our Balance Bike Taster Days. Almost without exception, schools tell us how quickly the children take to the activity and want to continue with more sessions.</p>\n                <p>For this reason, we have designed a program that uses the successful format and methods used in the taster days but builds progressively into a full 10-week course resulting in most children being able to ride independently by the end.</p>\n                <p>The course follows a structured program that each week sees the children progress steadily from initially sitting and walking to pushing and stepping, followed by striding and steering, ducking and weaving, and eventually confidently freewheeling - at which point we add pedals (the Strider 14X bike used for the course converts from balance bike to pedal bike) to continue the course on a conventional pedal bike.</p>\n                <p>The program encourages the children to learn through play and fun, exploring and learning at their own pace - there is no pressure to keep up with other children, instead, they learn the skills they need through taking part in lots of fun games and challenges that they love and want to practice and repeat.</p>\n                <p>For more information on getting started with the program, choose one of the options below to continue.</p>\n            </div>\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"After-School Clubs\",\n        img: \"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0583da_d84b1d629b3f47ed9332b7fa62fc52f7.jpg/v1/crop/x_436,y_0,w_2392,h_2448/fill/w_612,h_596,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/Whingate%20Armley_0775_JPG.webp\",\n        header: \"Our clubs are not only great for those who want to fuel their interest and develop new skills, but also for those who just want to hang out on their bikes with friends.\",\n        featured: false,\n        flyer: SchoolClubs,\n        description: <div>\n            <h2>School Clubs</h2>\n                <p>We offer clubs for all ages and abilities, from Early Years balance bike clubs for those who just want to have fun on two wheels (or learn to ride a pedal bike) to those older, perhaps more competitive children who want to try out cycle racing for the first time or develop their hobby and improve their technical skills.</p>\n                <p>Our clubs can run independently for just one age group or be offered to the whole school as 3 consecutive key stage sessions on one day of the week.
