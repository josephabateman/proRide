Aimed at giving school children a taste of bike racing and access to the sport rather than a road safety course, the program was a huge success with both children and staff and by the end of the year over 3,000 children had taken part in a Pro-Ride session.

This also proved popular with over 20 schools requesting the training and Durham CC commissioning their own course. In 2016 more services were added including competitions where schools ran a range of day, half day and inter-school events.
