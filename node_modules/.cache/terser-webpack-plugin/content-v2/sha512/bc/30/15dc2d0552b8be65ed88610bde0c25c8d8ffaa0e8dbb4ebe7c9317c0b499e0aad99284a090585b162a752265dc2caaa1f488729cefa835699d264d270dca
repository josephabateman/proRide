biking and how quickly they develop their\n          confidence and coordination. Within minutes children who have never\n          been on a bike before are walking confidently, sat on the saddle. Soon\n          they are weaving in and out of cones, ducking under limbos and flying\n          over ramps.

Under the\n          watchful eye of a qualified instructor, each child as young as three\n          learns the basics of stepping, striding, balancing, starting and\n          stopping, and turning through a series of fun activities in an\n          action-packed session.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Sessions can take place indoors or out depending on weather and are\n          suitable for all levels of ability from absolute beginners to\n          confident pedlers.

Based on this information, we put together a plan\n          for the day for your approval.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Taster days usually consist of 4 sessions - 2 in the morning and 2 in\n          the afternoon. The sessions vary in content depending on the age and\n          ability of those taking part but a typical session will start with a\n          bike and helmet check, then get underway by developing basic riding\n          skills on a track set up on the playground or, in summer, on the\n          grass.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Skills such as starting, stopping, cornering, riding close to others,\n          overtaking, riding in single file, in pairs, and in small groups are\n          all covered here. The focus then switches to developing bike handling\n          skills by using a series of activity stations where the children\n          tackle different obstacles such as slalom, limbo, and ramps. Finally,\n          the children get their chance to take on their friends in a series of\n          fun races tailored to the age and ability of the group and the space\n          available.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Children bring in their own bikes and helmets, but spares can be\n          provided by prior arrangement.

Days are\n          usually split into 3 with 2 sessions in the morning and one all\n          afternoon. The older children bring in their bikes, whilst the younger\n          one's can either borrow one of our balance/pedal bikes or bring in\n          their own.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    ),\n    fontAwesomeIcon: \"fas fa-cookie-bite\",\n    //the ks1 and ks2 flyer is same\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"KS2 Taster Days\",\n    img: svg3,\n    header:\n      \"A great way to encourage children to cycle more and sample cycle racing in a safe, controlled environment.\",\n    featured: false,\n    flyer:\n      \"https://ea67bc9c-a6b0-438e-82a8-d0e4df398e62.filesusr.com/ugd/0583da_5af40c0aa624483ea7edd16ef5eec163.pdf\",\n    description: (\n      <div>\n        <h3>Get your kids pedaling with a ProRide Cycling Taster Day</h3>\n        <p>\n          Cycling is a great activity for children in so many ways, yet for\n          many, finding somewhere safe and fun to ride their bikes and learn new\n          skills is difficult.
