This also proved popular with over 20 schools requesting the training and Durham CC commissioning their own course.</p>\n        <p>In 2016 more services were added including competitions where schools ran a range of day, half day and inter-school events. Phil is a qualified teacher, British Cycling level 2 coach, and registered Bikeability instructor.

Now, with a Pro-Ride Taster day, they can do just\n          that in the safety and security of their own school playground under\n          the supervision of a qualified coach.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Pro-Ride Taster days comprise multiple sessions in a day (usually 4)\n          that offer children in KS1 or KS2 the chance to learn new skills, gain\n          confidence and have fun with their friends.

Based on this information, we put together a plan\n          for the day for your approval.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Taster days usually consist of 4 sessions - 2 in the morning and 2 in\n          the afternoon. The sessions vary in content depending on the age and\n          ability of those taking part but a typical session will start with a\n          bike and helmet check, then get underway by developing basic riding\n          skills on a track set up on the playground or, in summer, on the\n          grass.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Skills such as starting, stopping, cornering, riding close to others,\n          overtaking, riding in single file, in pairs, and in small groups are\n          all covered here. The focus then switches to developing bike handling\n          skills by using a series of activity stations where the children\n          tackle different obstacles such as slalom, limbo, and ramps. Finally,\n          the children get their chance to take on their friends in a series of\n          fun races tailored to the age and ability of the group and the space\n          available.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Children bring in their own bikes and helmets, but spares can be\n          provided by prior arrangement. Helmets can be supplied.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Whole School Taster Days</h4>\n        <p>\n          For smaller schools, we operate a program that combines the above\n          program with our balance bike taster. This enables every child in the\n          school from Nursery to Year 6 to take part in a session. Days are\n          usually split into 3 with 2 sessions in the morning and one all\n          afternoon. The older children bring in their bikes, whilst the younger\n          one's can either borrow one of our balance/pedal bikes or bring in\n          their own.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    ),\n    fontAwesomeIcon: \"fas fa-school\",\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Learn-to-Ride Program (Freewheelerz)\",\n    img:\n      \"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0583da_8e33945dfdca4f81852fa6949ee477a1~mv2.jpg/v1/crop/x_30,y_0,w_218,h_209/fill/w_301,h_293,al_c,lg_1,q_80/278_209__1_IMG_48241.webp\",\n    header:\n      \"Our Learn to ride program, Freewheelers is designed to teach kids to ride a bike in 10 weeks using special convertible bikes.
