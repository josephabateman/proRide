      <p>
        Phil started racing as a junior in 1977 winning his first opne road race
        in Beverley near Hull. Following other local success including winning
        the Yorkshire Junior Championships in Halifax, Phil began to compete
        nationally finishing second in the Junior national time trial
        championships (BBAR) and later represented GB for the first time in the
        Junior World Championships in Mexico. Success at national and
        international level followed with strong performances in the Tour of
        Britain a bronze medal at the National Road Race Championships and a win
        against top professionals in the 1988 Pro-am Tour of Lancashire.
      </p>

        During his career, Phil won over 50 road races, five Yellow Jerseys and
        represented Team GB at three world championships and the 1988 Olympic
        Games in Seoul, Korea.

        Today Phil lives in Bradford where he continues to ride as much as
        possible locally whilst coaching full time for Pro-Ride.
