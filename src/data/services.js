        <p>
          Our Balance Bike Taster days are a great way to see how Early Years
          children respond to balance biking and how quickly they develop their
          confidence and coordination. Within minutes children who have never
          been on a bike before are walking confidently, sat on the saddle. Soon
          they are weaving in and out of cones, ducking under limbos and flying
          over ramps. Before long and within the session the same children are
          beginning to balance and freewheel as they continue to grow in
          confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each Taster Day offers multiple sessions (4-6 in a school day)
          catering for up to 60 children in 30-45 minute sessions. Under the
          watchful eye of a qualified instructor, each child as young as three
          learns the basics of stepping, striding, balancing, starting and
          stopping, and turning through a series of fun activities in an
          action-packed session.

          Sessions can take place indoors or out depending on weather and are
          suitable for all levels of ability from absolute beginners to
          confident pedlers. All equipment is provided including Strider balance
          bikes and helmets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taster days are designed as a stand-alone activity day and as such are
          suitable for use as a one-off experience but can be used to trial
          balance biking as a regular activity, perhaps prior to starting a
          school club or investing in equipment and training or running a
          Freewheelerz Learn to Ride Course.

          ability of those taking part but a typical session will start with a

          skills by using a series of activity stations where the children

          Three courses are currently available, one for EYFS and the others for

        <h4>Our new Freewheelerz Learn to Ride program for EYFS.</h4>â€‹
        <p>
          Think how amazing it would be if every child in your school could be
          taught how to ride a bike in the first couple of years of them
          joining! Well, now they can with Freewheelerz, our latest program for
          EYFS.
        </p>
        <p>
          The drive behind this new program came about as a result of the
          positive feedback we have been getting from our Balance Bike Taster
          Days. Almost without exception, schools tell us how quickly the
          children take to the activity and want to continue with more sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason, we have designed a program that uses the successful
          format and methods used in the taster days but builds progressively
          into a full 10-week course resulting in most children being able to
          ride independently by the end.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
    text2: (
      <>
        <p>
          The course follows a structured program that each week sees the
          children progress steadily from initially sitting and walking to
          pushing and stepping, followed by striding and steering, ducking and
          weaving, and eventually confidently freewheeling - at which point we
          add pedals (the Strider 14X bike used for the course converts from
          balance bike to pedal bike) to continue the course on a conventional
          pedal bike.
        </p>
        <p>
          The program encourages the children to learn through play and fun,
          exploring and learning at their own pace - there is no pressure to
          keep up with other children, instead, they learn the skills they need
          through taking part in lots of fun games and challenges that they love
          and want to practice and repeat.

        <h3>School Clubs</h3>
        <p>
          We offer clubs for all ages and abilities, from Early Years balance
          bike clubs for those who just want to have fun on two wheels (or learn
          to ride a pedal bike) to those older, perhaps more competitive
          children who want to try out cycle racing for the first time or
          develop their hobby and improve their technical skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our clubs can run independently for just one age group or be offered
          to the whole school as 3 consecutive key stage sessions on one day of
          the week. Clubs run all year round (weather permitting) and usually
          last between 45 minutes to an hour depending on age. Smaller schools
          may prefer a mixed-age club where sessions can be split into higher
          and lower abilities or by age with a coach working in each group.

          Bookings are usually made by parents/guardians using our online
          booking and payment system and where possible encouraged to set up a
          monthly direct debit payment which can be cancelled with one month
          notice. We are also able to take bookings on a block basis if
          preferred. This is usually for 6-7 week blocks paid at the start of a
          half term. On occasion, schools provide clubs free of charge to their
          students, in this case, we agree to charge the school a fixed amount
          to deliver a set number of sessions and places over a specific period.
          An invoice is then issued to the school following the last club
          session - as we do for most of our other programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          To help schools promote their clubs internally, we design and deliver
          posters and flyers (as electronic artwork) and provide a registration
          form for schools to print and use to minimise administration if
          required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parents/Carers are required to complete an application form detailing
          any special needs or medical conditions together with the arrangements
          for pick up after the club.

        <h4>KS2 Training & Competition Day</h4>â€‹
        <p>
          This one-day event is designed for one KS2 class (usually year 5 or 6)
          and is split into a morning training session which is spent coaching
          the basic skills needed for racing such as starting, cornering,
          climbing, group riding, and sprinting, followed by a mini-tournament
          in the afternoon which introduces the children to some of the
          different kinds of races found in the sport. Points are awarded for
          each race and totaled at the end where the winners are presented with
          certificates, medals, and/or a trophy.
